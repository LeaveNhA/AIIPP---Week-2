## Criterias

- [2] 2 pts - A valid CodeSkulptor URL was submitted.
- [2] 2 pts — Program implements the function rpsls() and the helper function name_to_number() with plausible code. Give partial credit of 1 pt if only the function rpsls() has plausible code.
- [1] 1 pt — Running the program does not throw an error.
- [1] 1 pt - Program prints blank lines between games.
- [2] Program prints  "Player chooses player_choice" "Player chooses player_choice" where  player_choice player_choice is a string of the form  "rock" "rock",  "paper" "paper",  "scissors" "scissors",  "lizard" "lizard" or  "Spock" "Spock". An example of a complete line of output is  "Player chooses scissors" "Player chooses scissors". Give 1 pt if program prints out number instead of string.
- [2] 2 pts — Program prints "Computer chooses comp_choice" "Computer chooses comp_choice" where comp_choice comp_choice is a string of the form "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard" "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard" or "Spock" "Spock". An example of a complete line of output is "Computer chooses scissors" "Computer chooses scissors". Give 1 pt if program prints out number instead of string.
- [1] 1 pt — Computer's guesses vary between five calls to rpsls() rpsls() in each run of the program.
- [1] 1 pt — Computer's guesses vary between runs of the program.
- [3] 3 pts — Program prints either "Player and computer tie!" "Player and computer tie!", "Player wins!" "Player wins!" or "Computer wins!" "Computer wins!" to report outcome. (1 pt for each message.)
- [3] 3 pts — Program chooses correct winner according to RPSLS rules. Please manually examine 5 cases for correctness. If all five cases are correct, award 3 pts; four cases correct award 2 pts; one to three cases correct award 1 pt; no cases correct award 0 pts.
